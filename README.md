**Scenario Based Questions - ML EduBridge**

--What I had done in this task.

1. In the above-mentioned file, I had done the **(K-Nearest Neighbor)KNN Classifier** for the data provided. 

2. Founded the values with an accuracy of **90%**.

3. The output had shown in the CSV file formate with the header as required. Also uploaded the output file as **output.csv**

4. The Code for this task will be in **ML_Task_EduBridge_KNN.ipynb** anyone can access it.

**Question - Description :-**

You need to classify fetal health to avoid the abnormalities for the child and mother while giving birth. You will be provided with a CSV consisting of 22 columns out of which the first 21 columns are the factors based on which you need to classify the fetal health which is the last column . You need to classify the health status into the following:

1. 0-Normal

2. 0-Suspect

3. 0-Pathological

The columns in the CSV are:

a) baseline value (Baseline Fetal Heart Rate)

b) accelerations (Number of accelerations per second)

c) fetal_movement (Number of fetal movements per second)

d) uterine_contractions (Number of uterine contractions per second)

e) light_decelerations (Number of LDs per second)

f) severe_decelerations (Number of SDs per second)

g) prolongued_decelerations (Number of PDs per second)

h) abnormal_short_term_variability (Percentage of time with abnormal short term variability)

i) mean_value_of_short_term_variability

j) percentage_of_time_with_abnormal_long_term_variability

k) mean_value_of_long_term_variability

l) histogram_width (Width of the histogram made using all values from a record)

m) histogram_min

n) histogram_max

o) histogram_number_of_peaks

p) histogram_number_of_zeroes

q) histogram_mode

r) histogram_mean

s) histogram_median

t) histogram_variance

u) histogram_tendency

v) fetal_health

**Training data set:**

This data set will be available to the developers for training their model.

**Sample Output:**

The output is given to show the format in which the output is expected (with header) and has no relation with above.

fetal_health

1.0

1.0

2.0

1.0

3.0

Create a CSV file with the header as “fetal_health”.
